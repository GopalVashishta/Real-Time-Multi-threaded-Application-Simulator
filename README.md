# Real-Time-Multi-threaded-Application-Simulator
Operating System Project Backend
#Problem Statement:
Description: Develop a simulator to demonstrate multithreading models (e.g., Many-to
One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many) and thread synchronization using semaphores and 
monitors. The simulator should visualize thread states and interactions, providing insights 
into thread management and CPU scheduling in multi-threaded environments.
